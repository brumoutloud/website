                        <p class="text-gray-300">Right in the city centre, bab! It's centred around Hurst Street, just a hop, skip, and a jump away from New Street Station.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300">Generally, yes. Like any city, it's always good to be aware of your surroundings, but Birmingham is a welcoming place for LGBTQ+ folks.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300">None in the city centre but there are a few options if you don't mind a short journey. The Greenhouse in Darlaston is a popular choice, boasting a swimming pool alongside its other facilities, perfect for a refreshing dip after a steam. For those who prefer to stay closer to Birmingham, Spartan in Erdington offers another welcoming space to unwind and relax. Heroes in Stourbridge is also worth checking out if you fancy a bit of a road trip.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300">Let's set the record straight: Birmingham's queer scene is a force to be reckoned with! Our Gay Village boasts a vibrant array of bars and clubs, rivaling the likes of Manchester's Canal Street, Brighton's Kemptown, and even London's Soho. And that's just the tip of the iceberg! Across the West Midlands, you'll find a whole host of LGBTQ+ venues and events, from cosy pubs to legendary clubs, drag shows to queer film festivals. We might not always get the spotlight, but we're proud to be a hidden gem of LGBTQ+ life in the UK.</p>
